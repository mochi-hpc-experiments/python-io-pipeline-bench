These results were collected on a Thinkpad X1 laptop with the following specifications:

* Ubuntu 25.04
* Python 3.14 (compiled from source with the GIL disabled)
* 32 GiB of RAM
* 512 GiB Sandisk SN810 NVMe drive
* Intel i7-1365U processor (12 CPU threads)

The two data files here reflect running the benchmark both with and without the GIL enabled in the Python interpreter.
